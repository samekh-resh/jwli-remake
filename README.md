### How Itâ€™s Made
<b>Langs used</b> Html5 and CSS3

This was an exercise in recreating a website. I had to create a nav, some duo columnns and a few nested lists for the footer. The main goal was to learn how to organize and format the different sections of the website while still having the format look nice. Another exercise within this was media queries. I had to make 3 media queries, for mobile, tablet and desktop

### optimizations

The css could definitely be better. Using Flexbox or CSS grid would have been easier, but I wanted to familarize myself with the usage of floats, margins and paddings when it came to formatting the website. 

### Lessons Learned

Be very careful of the classes you give to your tags and the properties you use to style them. The Main reason I said this is due to the "Our History" portion of the website, where I had to have an tow images in an adjacent column to a text block. I gave them both the same classes and was constantly struggling to get them to be the desired size, until I realize they both had the same class and I was overriding the cascade.
